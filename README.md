# pi-deep-research

**Deep research skill for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent) — structured search, reflection, and analysis.**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](LICENSE)

Instead of shallow search-and-summarize, it enforces structured methodology: plan → search → reflect → iterate → report. A code-enforced checkpoint gate prevents the agent from rushing to conclusions before gathering enough evidence.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-deep-research
```

Then configure at least one search provider:

```bash
# SearXNG (recommended, self-hosted, free, unlimited)
export SEARXNG_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
# Or set it in pi settings.json:
#   { "deepresearch": { "searxngBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8080" } }

# Tavily (fallback, free: 1000 req/month)
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-..."
```

> **SearXNG setup**: the instance must enable JSON output in `settings.yml`
> (`search.formats: [html, json]`), otherwise the API returns 403.
> See https://searxng.org to self-host.

## Usage

### Slash Command

```
/research [depth] [topic]
```

Depth levels:
| Depth | Searches | Sources | Confidence | Time |
|-------|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----:|
| `quick` | 1-3 | 3-5 | 60% | ~2 min |
| `standard` | 3-6 | 5-10 | 75% | ~5 min |
| `deep` | 5-10 | 10-15 | 85% | ~10 min |
| `exhaustive` | 10-20 | 15-30 | 95% | ~20 min |

Examples:
```
/research quick what is MCP protocol
/research deep competitive analysis of AI coding assistants
/research exhaustive quantum computing applications in drug discovery
```

### Natural Language

The skill also activates when you ask the agent to research, investigate, or survey a topic:

```
Investigate the current state of AI agent frameworks
Investigate the current state of WebAssembly adoption
```

## Quick Start

```
/research deep AI agent frameworks comparison 2026
```

Produces a comprehensive Markdown research report with executive summary, cross-referenced analysis, source credibility ratings, and contradiction tracking.

## Demo

### 1. Start a research task

### 2. Review and approve the plan

The agent presents sub-questions and search queries, then waits for your approval before spending API calls.

### 3. Checkpoint: keep searching or proceed?

After each search round, the `research_checkpoint` tool evaluates progress. Here it says 🔴 **CONTINUE** — confidence is too low and contradictions need resolving:

After more rounds, all criteria are met — 🟢 **PROCEED**:

### 4. Research complete

The agent generates a structured Markdown report with findings summary:

### 5. Full report output

A comprehensive research report with Executive Summary, Key Findings, cross-referenced analysis, and source citations:

### 💡 Tips: Visual HTML report

Pair with [visual-explainer](https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer) to turn the Markdown report into a styled HTML page:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer
```

Then ask: `Turn this report into a visual HTML page`

## Why

LLMs doing "research" typically search once, skim snippets, and produce a surface-level summary. This skill fixes that by:

1. **Forcing deep reading** — instructs the agent to use `web_extract` on substantive sources, not just rely on search snippets
2. **Code-enforced reflection** — a `research_checkpoint` tool that evaluates progress against hard thresholds (min rounds, min sources, confidence score) and returns CONTINUE/PROCEED verdicts the agent must obey
3. **Multi-hop reasoning** — Entity Expansion, Temporal Progression, Conceptual Deepening, and Causal Chain patterns with concrete examples
4. **Analytical writing** — anti-patterns ("Source A says X. Source B says Y." ❌) vs analytical style ("Evidence converges on X because..." ✅)
5. **Human-in-the-Loop** — research plan must be approved before execution begins

## How It Works

### 4-Phase Workflow

```
Phase 1: Understand & Plan
  ↓ (user approves plan)
Phase 2: Search & Gather (multi-hop reasoning, deep reading)
  ↓
Phase 3: Checkpoint & Reflect (MANDATORY — code-enforced)
  ↓ 🔴 CONTINUE? → back to Phase 2
  ↓ 🟢 PROCEED? → continue
Phase 4: Synthesize & Report (Markdown file)
```

### Research Checkpoint (the key innovation)

After every search round, the agent **must** call the `research_checkpoint` tool. This tool runs 6 hard rules:

| Rule | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| Min search rounds | Haven't done enough rounds for this depth level |
| Min sources | Not enough unique sources collected |
| Answered ratio | Too many sub-questions still unanswered |
| Avg confidence | Overall confidence below depth threshold |
| Low-confidence questions | Any sub-question below 40% confidence |
| Unresolved contradictions | Sources disagree and it hasn't been resolved |

If any rule fails → **🔴 CONTINUE** (with specific guidance on what to search next).
All rules pass → **🟢 PROCEED** (agent may write the report).

Safety valve: after max rounds, forces PROCEED and flags remaining gaps.

### Multi-Hop Reasoning Patterns

- **Entity Expansion**: Product → Company → Competitors → Market position
- **Temporal Progression**: Current state → Recent changes → Historical context
- **Conceptual Deepening**: Overview → Architecture → Trade-offs → Edge cases
- **Causal Chain**: Observation → Immediate cause → Root cause → Solutions
- **Source Triangulation**: Official docs × Independent analysis × Community experience

## Report Output

Reports are saved as Markdown files: `research_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD].md`

Sections include:
- **Executive Summary** — conclusion first, then evidence
- **Key Findings** — ranked by importance with source citations
- **Detailed Analysis** — cross-referenced sub-questions with original analysis
- **Comparison Table + Narrative** — data and insight together
- **Contradictions & Debates** — vendor claims vs independent evidence
- **Uncertainties & Gaps** — explicitly flagged low-confidence areas
- **Recommendations** — primary, alternative, not recommended
- **Sources Table** — every URL with date and credibility tier (⭐🔵🟡🔴)

## Package Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Research workflow, behavioral mindset, multi-hop patterns, checkpoint rules |
| `extension.ts` | `web_search` + `web_extract` + `research_checkpoint` tools |
| `prompts/research.md` | `/research` slash command template |
| `references/config.md` | Depth thresholds, credibility tiers, confidence formula |
| `references/report-template.md` | Report structure, writing anti-patterns, quality requirements |

## Configuration

### Search Providers

| Provider | Config | Free Tier |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| [SearXNG](https://searxng.org) (primary) | `deepresearch.searxngBaseUrl` in settings.json, or `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` env var | Self-hosted, unlimited |
| [Tavily](https://tavily.com) (fallback) | `TAVILY_API_KEY` env var | 1000 req/month |

The extension tries SearXNG first (if configured), falls back to Tavily. If neither is configured, it shows a helpful error.

> **Note:** SearXNG failures (including a 403 from an instance without JSON output enabled) fall through silently to Tavily. If SearXNG appears not to work, check the instance's `search.formats` setting.

### Depth Defaults

Override in `references/config.md`:
- Confidence thresholds per depth level
- Min/max search rounds
- Source count requirements
- Credibility tier weights

## Design Decisions

This skill is built on insights from [SuperClaude's DeepResearch](https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework) architecture and academic foundations including:

- **Reflexion** (Shinn et al. 2023) — self-reflective loops with explicit evaluation
- **Chain-of-Thought** (Wei et al. 2022) — structured reasoning decomposition
- **ReAct** (Yao et al. 2023) — interleaved reasoning and action
- **Multi-hop QA** (Yang et al. 2018) — cross-document reasoning

Key design principles:
1. **Forceful imperative wording** for reference file loading — LLMs skip polite requests
2. **Exact keyword matching** for depth selection — prevents natural-language ambiguity from overriding explicit depth choices
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** at plan stage — API calls are costly, confirm before executing
4. **Code-enforced checkpoints** — LLMs self-evaluate optimistically, code doesn't
